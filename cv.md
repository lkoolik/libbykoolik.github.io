<h3>Research Experience</h3>
<h4>Apte Group Laboratory</h4>
<i> University of California, Berkeley </i> 

<b> Graduate Student Researcher </b> (08/2021-present)
<ul>
  <li>Develops computational pipelines for estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure disparities associated with changes in emissions.</li>
  <li>Coordinates with California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessments and environmental justice groups to provide useful tools for iterating through emissions scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cziczo Group Laboratory</h4>
<i> Massachusetts Institute of Technology </i>

<b> Graduate Research Fellow </b> (02/2017-01/2018)
<ul>
  <li>Designed and constructed a first of its kind comprehensive phase-separation inlet system for studying the aerosols that activate water droplet and ice crystal nucleation in mixed-phase clouds.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated proof of concept during a field campaign at the summit of Mt. Washington by measuring mixed-phase clouds using the inlet.</li>
  <li>Constructed 3D models of individual unique instrument components and fabricated them using a stereolithographic 3D printer.</li>
  <li>Wrote computational pipelines in Matlab for analyzing large amounts of particle concentration data collected through laboratory and field studies.</li>
