### About Me
Hi, I'm Libby! I am a first year PhD student at University of California, Berkeley, studying air pollution exposures in the Department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://ce.berkeley.edu/). Prior to starting at Berkeley, I got my bachelor's in [Atmospheric Science](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) and my master's in [Environmental Engineering](https://cee.mit.edu/) at MIT. In between, I worked as an Air Quality Consultant at [Ramboll](https://ramboll.com/services-and-sectors/environment-and-health/air-quality-management). At Berkeley, I am part of the [Apte Group](https://apte.berkeley.edu/).
