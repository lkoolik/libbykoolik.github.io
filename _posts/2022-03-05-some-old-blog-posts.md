While a student at MIT, I had the opportunity to work on developing a new inlet for studying mixed-phase clouds. Along with primary investigator [Dan Cziczo](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/people/profile/djcziczo.html) and postdoctoral fellow [Michael RÃ¶sch](https://iac.ethz.ch/people-iac/person-detail.html?persid=244090), I designed and built the Phase Separation Inlet for Droplets, Ice Residuals, and Interstitial Aerosol Particles (SPIDER). 

While this website didn't exist when I was at MIT, I wanted to pay homage to some of the previous blog posts I made, as well as other coverage of this project. 

My blog posts are listed below:
* (04/15/2017) **[SPIDER WEB: The Introduction](https://medium.com/@lpkoolik/spider-web-the-introduction-3bb7e7e7bdfe)**: an overview of the process of designing and building the SPIDER inlet.
* (04/19/2017) **[Getting to Mount Washington](https://medium.com/@lpkoolik/getting-to-mount-washington-cf522e7586a0)**:  a story about four trips up to the Mount Washington Observatory, and what it takes to get an instrument like SPIDER onto a frozen mountaintop.
* (04/23/2017) **[Daily Summit Log](https://medium.com/@lpkoolik/daily-summit-log-ec52a9f73227)**: a summary of my daily routine during my week doing field work at the Mount Washington Observatory
