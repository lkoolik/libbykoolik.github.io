On April 27th, I received a formal notification that the SPIDER paper was accepted for publication at Atmospheric Measurement Techniques. Today - the paper was published! Check out our official citation here:

[tbd]

The SPIDER validation experiment paper is both my first publication and my first first author publication! I am so proud of the work we have done, and I have learned so much from this experience. I wanted to write a short blog post in plain English summarizing (1) what is in this paper, (2) why this work matters, and (3) my major takeaways as a first time author.

<h3>Summary of Manuscript</h3>
SPIDER is a novel inlet for studying interstitial aerosol particles and cloud residuals from mixed-phase clouds. SPIDER works by combining known cloud particle sorting techniques and thermodynamic properties of cloud particles in series. SPIDER works through a three step process:
<ol>
  <li><b>Large Pumped Counterflow Virtual Impactor (L-PCVI)</b>: uses aerodynamic principles in order to reject all small interstitial (unactivated) aerosol.</li>
  <li><b>Droplet Evaporation Chamber</b>: Uses the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen thermodynamic process to shrink the cloud droplets.</li>
  <li><b>Pumped Counterflow Virtual Impactor (PCVI)</b>: uses aerodynamic principles in order to separate the small cloud droplet residuals from the larger ice crystals.</li>
</ol>

The result is that the SPIDER inlet system separates mixed-phase clouds into three distinct channels for simultaneous sampling:
<ol>
  <li> Interstitial Aerosol: aerosol particles that never initiated a cloud meteor </li>
  <li> Cloud Droplet Residuals: aerosol particles that nucleated a liquid droplet in the mixed-phase cloud</li>
  <li> Ice Crystal Residuals: aerosol particles that nucleated a solid ice crystal in the mixed-phase cloud </li>
 </ol>
 
In the manuscript, we test and validate each of these individual components, as well as the system as a whole. Given the operating conditions we recommend, we see that the SPIDER system is able to properly separate particles into the three distinct channels as intended.

<h3>Importance of SPIDER Inlet</h3>

Climate change is an existential threat to our planet the way we know it [(link)](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release/). Many scientists are actively working on estimating the impacts of potential climate change scenarios or mitigation (avoidance) pathways. Because we cannot experiment on our actual planet, atmospheric models have been developed to perform best guess estimations of what will happen in the future given a set of initial conditions. One of the largest unknowns in the climate system to date is the role of aerosols (small particles suspended in the air) and clouds [(link)](https://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-2-1-figure-2.html). To understand this, let's dive in a little bit closer.

<b>Aerosol</b> is a broad term describing a particle (liquid or solid) suspended in the air. Aerosols can influence the climate system in a few different ways [(link)](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/aerosols-and-climate/). First, aerosols themselves can absorb or reflect incoming sunlight. Just like icebergs reflect sunlight by increasing the Earth's albedo, many aerosols can reflect sunlight back into space. Other aerosols (e.g., black carbon "soot") can actually absorb heat, trapping the energy in the atmosphere. This phenomenon where aerosols are directly interacting with atmospheric heat is called <b>the direct effect</b>. Aerosols can also act as the base or "nucleating particle" for a cloud. The overabundance of aerosols can change the properties of clouds (e.g., albedo, lifetime) formed in the exact same conditions. This effect is far more complicated and is known as <b>the indirect effect</b>. 

One special classification of clouds is the <b>mixed-phase cloud</b>. There isn't a single definition of a mixed-phase cloud; instead, it's an umbrella term for any cloud that contains both liquid droplets and solid ice crystals at the same time. These clouds are even less well understood. One major limitation in current knowledge about mixed-phase clouds is how the two phases of matter form under similar environmental conditions. This is important for climate change, as ice crystals and droplets have different radiative properties. As we continue to change the aerosol landscape, it is important to understand how different aerosols nucleate droplets or crystals.

Because there is so much uncertainty surrounding aerosols and clouds, it is critical that scientists continue studying and parameterizing them. However, it can be difficult and/or expensive to do these studies. The SPIDER inlet provides a novel mechanism for sorting cloud particle types. Using SPIDER, scientists can sample a cloud and sort the aerosols based not only on whether or not it nucleated a cloud particle, but also whether it nucleated a liquid droplet or ice crystal. Furthermore, because it incorporates 3D printed materials, the SPIDER inlet is relatively inexpensive.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
Now that the SPIDER inlet is validated, it's time to get to work! We performed two proof-of-concept field campaigns with the SPIDER inlet: one at the Mount Washington Weather Observatory in [city], NH, and one at the Stork Peak Laboratory in Steamboat Springs, CO.
