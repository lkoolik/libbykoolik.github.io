On April 27th, I received a formal notification that the SPIDER paper was accepted for publication at Atmospheric Measurement Techniques. Today - the paper was published! Check out our official citation here:

The SPIDER validation experiment paper is both my first publication and my first first author publication! I am so proud of the work we have done, and I have learned so much from this experience. I wanted to write a short blog post in plain English summarizing (1) what is in this paper, (2) why this work matters, and (3) my major takeaways as a first time author.

<h3>Importance of SPIDER Inlet</h3>

Climate change is an existential threat to our planet the way we know it [(link)](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release/). Many scientists are actively working on estimating the impacts of potential climate change scenarios or mitigation (avoidance) pathways. Because we cannot experiment on our actual planet, atmospheric models have been developed to perform best guess estimations of what will happen in the future given a set of initial conditions. One of the largest unknowns in the climate system to date is the role of aerosols (small particles suspended in the air) and clouds [(link)](https://archive.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-2-1-figure-2.html). To understand this, let's dive in a little bit closer.

<b>Aerosol</b> is a broad term describing a particle (liquid or solid) suspended in the air. Aerosols can influence the climate system in a few different ways [(link)](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/aerosols-and-climate/). First, aerosols themselves can absorb or reflect incoming sunlight. Just like icebergs reflect sunlight by increasing the Earth's albedo, many aerosols can reflect sunlight back into space. Other aerosols (e.g., black carbon "soot") can actually absorb heat, trapping the energy in the atmosphere. This phenomenon where aerosols are directly interacting with atmospheric heat is called <b>the direct effect</b>. Aerosols can also act as the base or "nucleating particle" for a cloud. The overabundance of aerosols can change the properties of clouds (e.g., albedo, lifetime) formed in the exact same conditions. This effect is far more complicated and is known as <b>the indirect effect</b>. 

One special classification of clouds is the <b>mixed-phase cloud</b>.

Because there is so much uncertainty surrounding aerosols and clouds, it is critical that scientists continue studying and parameterizing them. However, it can be difficult and/or expensive to do these studies.
