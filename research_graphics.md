## Research Graphics

I am passionate about designing easy-to-understand graphics for my research talks. Below are a few examples of my graphics. Please feel free to use them with proper attribution.

### InMAP Methodology
The following images help visualize the [InMAP Source-Receptor Matrix](https://zenodo.org/records/7548607) created by Chris Tessum et al.

I designed this graphic to show how there are individual layers of the InMAP Source Receptor Matrix (ISRM) for each pollutant.

I designed this graphic to illustrate how a fine-scale resolution model like InMAP can be trained by the parameters from a lower-spatial resolution model like CMAQ or WRF-Chem.
